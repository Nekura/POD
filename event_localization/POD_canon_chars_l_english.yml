 PODcanon_chars.1.t:0 "New Beginnings"
 PODcanon_chars.1.desc:0 "It is finally done. The fool, Menele of Sparta, is dead and you are, for the first time in millennia, free to do as you wish. The victory feels more... hollow than you would have thought, as you suddenly lost what has been your purpose in unlife... but you will move on, as you always do.\nThe world has forgotten you, and even the oldest Toreador think you a myth at this point. This might play to your advantage. It is time to return to the world of Cainite politics, a world you know so well, but with a distinct advantage : nobody important is even truly suspicious of your true powers.\nThis is an asset that will prove very useful, and that you intent to keep for as long as possible..."
 PODcanon_chars.1.a:0 "My ascension can finally begin"
 PODcanon_chars.helena:0 "You have unlocked a new character interaction on foreign rulers : Infiltrate"
 PODcanon_chars.2.t:0 "Awakening of a God"
 PODcanon_chars.2.desc:0 "It is finally done. You have nearly completed the ritual to invoke Svantevit into a willing host. You can't wait to feel the power of a God flowing through your undying veins!\nThere is a small issue though, during your research, you found that the host's mind is supposed to be wiped out by Svantevit's arrival. Obviously, you are of strong will and wouldn't give up as easily as some of the idiots cultists you crushed but... this is still concerning.\nSimply deciphering the ritual already taught you a lot, and might be a sufficient reward in itself.\nOr you could summon a God and try to bend it to your will. The choice is yours... perhaps for the last time."
 PODcanon_chars.2.a:0 "Ultimate Power!"
 PODcanon_chars.2.b:0 "...I'm not feeling it"
 PODcanon_chars.3.t:0 "Romance of the Gods"
 PODcanon_chars.3.desc:0 "She is back.\nThe beloved daughter of Isis has joined your side again, and a flurry of conflicting emotions rushes back to you. What you had this one time was passionate, if fleeting. Perhaps your story will endure the test of time better now that you are both older and, hopefully, wiser.\nAt the very least, it will be interesting, especially as your vassals are already grumbling behind your back. Kemintiri never was the most popular figure among them.\nBut you don't care. She is back and the unlife seems worth living again, hopefully for a long while."
 PODcanon_chars.3.a:0 "Let us remake this land in our image"
 PODcanon_chars.mithras:0 "You have unlocked a new timed major decision"
 PODcanon_chars.4.t:0 "Trial by War"
 PODcanon_chars.4.desc:0 "You have planned a succession of quick and decisive skirmishes against this rebellious vassal of yours. If you manage to achieve victory, you will be safe from rebellion, from this one at least, for a while.\nBetter be sure before launching the attack though, if you lose, the consequences will be worse than not attempting such an action at all..."
 PODcanon_chars.4.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"
 PODcanon_chars.4.b:0 "Tonight is not the night"
 PODcanon_chars.4.effect.success.desc:0 "Winning will break the vassal spirit for a while"
 PODcanon_chars.4.success:0 "Victory!"
 PODcanon_chars.4.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "Losing will embolden the vassal's rebellious spirit"
 PODcanon_chars.4.failure:0 "Defeated..."
 PODcanon_chars.5.t:0 "Looking Up the Pyramid"
 PODcanon_chars.5.desc:0 "It is time for you to use your rightful power as master of the Tremere clan for some good old fashioned Hermetics politics. Since you are on top of the pyramid, you will win at the end, it it just a question of what will you specifically gain from it.\nSo many choices with so little consequences! Except annoying those below you obviously. Not that it matters much."
 PODcanon_chars.5.a:0 "Steal someone else ideas"
 PODcanon_chars.5.b:0 "Blame someone else for your failures"
 PODcanon_chars.5.c:0 "Requisition from the clan's coffers"
 PODcanon_chars.5.d:0 "I'm not in the mood for politics"
 PODcanon_chars.6.t:0 "Alamut's Rewards"
 PODcanon_chars.6.desc:0 "The leadership of the Children of Haqim are pleased by the progress of the Midnight Crescent in Iberia. They send you their best regards and congratulations, along with reinforcements, promising neonates of the Vizir, Sorcerer and Warrior castes.\nYour work is not yet done, but the pressure on you is now less crushing, at it seems they finally trust you to have the best interest of the clan in mind. Even perhaps by making Iberia a future grand stronghold worthy of Haqim himself."
 PODcanon_chars.6.a:0 "I am the talk of the decade in Alamut"
 PODcanon_chars.7.t:0 "Plots Within Plots"
 PODcanon_chars.7.desc:0 "You managed to learn more about this potential foe. It is always an oddly comforting feeling for you, Prince Roque, as you love outsmarting your enemies and ensnaring them into a web of improbable plots.\nStill, you sometimes don't scheme only for the sake of scheming. You could exploit the information you obtained for even further plotting!"
 PODcanon_chars.7.a:0 "Start some more schemes against this one!"
 PODcanon_chars.7.b:0 "Intrigue is such a soothing pastime..."
 PODcanon_chars.7.c:0 "Let everyone know the extent of your scheming skills!"
 PODcanon_chars.8.t:0 "Making Waves"
 PODcanon_chars.8.desc:0 "Lord Montano, with the return of most of Italy under your control, you showed clan Lasombra that you are still an effective and decisive ruler. There is, obviously, still much to be done to restore the proper place of the Sea of Shadows in the Mediterranean world but, at the very least, your position as head of the clan isn't contested anymore.\nYou are now able to use it to claim rulership over any wayward Lasombra princedoms."
 PODcanon_chars.8.a:0 "I can do even better"
 PODcanon_chars.montano:0 "You now have a special bonus to acceptance of the 'Offer Vassalization' interaction with any Lasombra ruler"
 PODcanon_chars.9.t:0 "A Loving Embrace"
 PODcanon_chars.9.desc:0 "You are difficult to resist when you put your mind into something, beautiful Maatkare, but the Cainites are stubborn creatures. If you are to show this one the love of Set, it will take all your considerable skills in persuasion and seduction to achieve.\nThere is always a risk of failure, which would cost you quite a bit in Set's unforgiving eyes..."
 PODcanon_chars.9.a:0 "Set's glory can't wait"
 PODcanon_chars.9.b:0 "Tonight is not the night"
 PODcanon_chars.9.effect.success.desc:0 "Winning will make this character convert to Via Set"
 PODcanon_chars.9.success:0 "Praise Set!"
 PODcanon_chars.9.critical.failure.effect.desc:0 "Losing will cost you quite a bit"
 PODcanon_chars.9.failure:0 "I failed..."
 PODcanon_chars.10.t:0 "Walking the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.10.desc:0 "You have seen those 'Black Spiral Dancers', they are utterly mad, even by your loose standards. Is the tiny possibility of an answer to your pain worth it? The only thing that can be said for sure is that you won't be the same once you go back from this cursed place..."
 PODcanon_chars.10.a:0 "No turning back now"
 PODcanon_chars.10.b:0 "This is a very very bad idea"
 PODcanon_chars.petaniqua:0 "You are more than likely going back from here worse that you started. But there might be a tiny hope of something worthwhile..."
 PODcanon_chars.11.t:0 "Madness of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.11.desc:0 "People think you have come back from the Black Spiral relatively unchanged. But you know better, you never came back from it. It is with you now.\nAnd these...things you saw will never leave your vision. Perhaps the whole world is simply an extension of it. Or you are simply too far gone to care anymore.\nYou don't want to go back in there. Or do you?"
 PODcanon_chars.11.a:0 "There is no light anymore"
 PODcanon_chars.12.t:0 "Clarity of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.12.desc:0 "You don't remember much of your journey in the Black Spiral which is... probably for the best. You have found no hidden truths, or sordid horrors. If you had, you would have some memories of them right?\nAnyway, despite what could be called a setback, you are relieved to be out of there. The outside world seems oddly pleasant now."
 PODcanon_chars.12.a:0 "It could have been worse"
 PODcanon_chars.13.t:0 "Strength of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.13.desc:0 "There is no doubt that the Black Spiral is a place of utter madness. But you have been through so much in your life, and unlife, that it has not shattered you this time. You conquered your fears, and 'it' was pleased by your performance.\nDespite this show of force, you will admit being glad to join the outside world again. This was far from a relaxing experience..."
 PODcanon_chars.13.a:0 "I'm not easily spooked"
 PODcanon_chars.14.t:0 "Gift of the Black Spiral"
 PODcanon_chars.14.desc:0 "You found him.\nPerhaps the Black Spiral took pity on you, or was impressed by your dedication. Perhaps it is just a dream, a fantasy of your broken mind. You don't care.\nHe is with you now, and all will be well once again."
 PODcanon_chars.14.a:0 "You are meant to be King of the world"
 PODcanon_chars.petaniqua2:0 "You have no reasons to walk the Black Spiral from now on"
