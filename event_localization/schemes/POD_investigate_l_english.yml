 POD_investigate.1.t.camilla:0 "Lore: Camilla"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.camilla:0 "Perhaps the most influential Ventrue of history, Titus Venturus Camille was a promising young Roman tutored by the best teachers, be they Collat, his future sire and Prince of Rome, or Lysander and Artemis Orthia of Sparta. A strong sense of rulership and a devoring ambition were soon born, and Camilla took his Sire's throne, some say by diablerie. He will then rule Rome from the Republican era to the Imperial one, pioneering the Eternal Senate and the concept of Masquerade. It is also his command that took down the city of Carthage, earning him the enmity of Brujah for all eternity.\n Even more famously, Camilla would fall in with the burgeoning Road of Sin and become one of its more... skillful adepts. Despite his carefree and sometimes indolent attitude, Camilla managed to keep the reins of power over most of the Cainite world for a millenia, a feat never seen before or after. \n He felt into torpor at the end of the Roman Imperial era, and every semblance of unity in the Cainite world fell with him. He finally awakens in 1230 and easily slips back into power in Rome. But the world has changed much, and it is unlikely that the Prince of Sin will be able to once again rule over Europe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camilla will fall into torpor during the Medieval era, only to rise in the early 21th century. An old foe will await his return to avenge a grudge as old as Rome itself."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.mithras:0 "Once a soldier in the first days of Persia, Mithras has made quite a legacy for himself. Using his powers and incontestable skills at manipulation and persuasion, he soon created a new backstory, that of the Sun God of the same name. This allowed him to be one of the most powerful Ventrue of the ancient world, especially when his cult spreads to Imperial Rome. \n But Christianity and his many rivals got the better of him, and he fled with his following to the frontiers of the Empire, in Britain. The pettiness of the place quickly bore him and he felt into a cycle of torpor, awakening to find everything in shambles due to incompetent regents, fixing it, and then torpor again. \n The last cycle was after 1066, when ambitious Norman Vampires ousted his power base from the island, forcing him to awaken once more and deal with it. As of 1230, the Sun God is once again annoyed by Britain and his influence is strong enough that he could consider another retreat into the sleep of ages. Though it is said that the upstart Hardestadt, claiming overlordship over Clan Ventrue, is angering his much older clanmate. This could be reason enough for him to stay a little while longer... \n Future fate in Canon \n Mithras will stay awake for some time, being a thorn on the side of Hardestadt during the Camarilla's foundation. He felt into torpor once more, to finally be killed in 1996 when Valerius, one of his former regents, betrays him. Though, some spoke of a contingency plan..."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.leeland:0 "Not much is known about Robin's early days, except for the theory that he is the legendary folklore figure known as Robin Hood. His actions certainly allude to this, as he is probably the most well known Furores of the Cainite world. \n Always rebelling and fighting against tyrants, he has gathered quite a following for himself and is even considered a worthy foe by Mithras, the Sun God of England. \n Future fate in Canon \n Leeland will never stop fighting the good fight.

Confidante of Etrius, respected by Goratrix, she has taken part in the original ritual that created the Tremere Clan. Since then, her efforts to find new allies for her beleaguered clan have been tireless. \n Mithras, the Sun God of England, has been reluctant to acknowledge the Tremere, as he is a friend of the Salubri Clan. As such, Meerlinda is quietly gathering followers and influence in the isles, with the goal of ushering a more 'amenable' King to power... \n Future fate in Canon \n Meerlinda will align herself with Hardestadt's Camarilla, securing the power of Clan Tremere for centuries to come.

A scion of Clan Toreador, she worked the politics of France with reckless abandon, earning her the enmity of her sister in blood Isouda and a one way trip to exile. \n Arriving in England, she hasn't changed much, styling herself as the main opposition of an amused Mithras and narrating grand tales of her past as the 'Fay of Lusignan'. Her cold and callous temper hasn't win her any friends either. \n Future fate in Canon \n Unsurprisingly, Melusine won't achieve much of significance, and is soon forgotten by History."

Betraying his sire at an opportune time, he was also quick to pledge his allegiance to Mithras when the Sun God reappeared. His rule over York needs his attention, as the remnants of the Einherjar Vikings are still barely subdued. John hasn't forgotten his freedom from before though, and is one of the main conspirators against the Persian Methuselah's rule. As such, he has gathered a circle of like minded vassals, including Melusine d'Anjou and Meerlinda, patiently waiting for Mithras to make a mistake. \n Future fate in Canon \n John's trust in Meerlinda will prove his undoing."

Being embraced by Mithras himself was a true awakening for Marcus, who then dedicated his unlife to the Sun God he so cherished. Since then, he has been the pillar of Mithras' will in England, maintaining the cult during the Methuselah's absence and hunting any dissidence to the rule of his Sire and God. Still a military man before all, Marcus is more often seen on the battlefield than in courts or temples, leading the Mithraic faithful to victory. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Roman will suffer a major crisis of faith and will then walk a darker path."

The Ventrue neonate barely survived the harrowing experience and lashed out on his sire, diablerizing him in the process.

The cold war between those two came crashing when Lorraine, Salianna's prized childe, was killed by Alexander in a fit of rage. She then carefully plotted his demise, and managed to achieve it in 1224, with the help of Alexander's childe, Geoffrey du Temple. \n Now, for the first time in her life, Salianna is truly in charge. But wolves are circling around her coveted position, be they the exiled Alexander, the rebelling Esclarmonde or Geoffrey himself. \n Future fate in Canon \n Salianna won't enjoy her victory for long.

Returning to Paris, Geoffrey eagerly took part in the conspiracy against his sire, which earned him the princedom of Paris. Still, everybody knows that Salianna is now the real power in France and Geoffrey is, once more, chaffing under a figure much more older and powerful than he is. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Ventrue crusader will never achieve much, succumbing to the same constant anger that plagued his sire.

A cold war he lost when Tremere awakened just long enough to exile Goratrix to France. \n Bitter at the idea, he still made good use of his new position, establishing a strong chantry in Rouen and a network of friends and allies. Some of those including the new power couple of the Kingdom, Salianna and Geoffrey. \n Future fate in Canon \n Goratrix's influence in France will grow until he is exiled for good and declares his antitribu.

Even as everything burns around her, the 'Black Queen' isn't ready to give up. \n Future fate in Canon \n Esclarmonde will miraculously defends her realm against the Crusaders and the northerners for several decades longer.

Some time later, she bites the hand of a too close for comfort old nobleman. Her burning spirit, ruthless ambition and comely beauty earned her the embrace. \n Isouda was as quick to adapt to Vampire society as you would expect. Organizing the exile or 'disappearance' of her sister Melusine and other rivals, she rose to the throne of Anjou. Thwarted in her attempt to grab France after Alexander's exile, Isouda is already planning a bloody vengeance against Salianna. Or anyone else who isn't firmly in her thrall for that matter.\nFuture fate in Canon\nIsouda will navigate the French politics with the same reckless attitude she always had.

All the while happily dancing and listening to romantic stories in her great hall. Salianna appears overprotective of her fickle childe, but Helene's courtiers can testify that she knows how to take care of herself.

This oddity doesn't make her a pariah though, as she has demonstrated a very good political sense when she participated in the coup against Alexander. \n She lost a lot in the process though, with the betrayal of Jean Baptiste de Montrond. As such she has chosen to take a step back from Parisian politics to go back to her native Orleans. But trouble is never far from one such as Veronique. \n Future fate in Canon \n Indeed, the Brujah will not spent the rest of her unlife quietly in Orleans.

Traveling with her, and teaching her, they have come to France where Anatole was critical in destroying the Heretic leader known as St-Lys. Now, Anatole and his pupil have moved south to hunt the remaining heretics and learn from each other a little while longer. \n Future fate in Canon \n Anatole will never stop wandering and making friends, but his faith will dwindle, making him more of a Gehenna prophet than an holy man in his later years.

Since then, Silvester's ascension has been impressive, becoming the youngest member of the Amici Nocti and the leader of the clan in Iberia in less than 500 years. He only has to finish the Reconquista and the whole clan could be his. \n Future fate in Canon \n Unfortunately for him, Silvester finds an even better Jyhad player than him, his own childe.

Lucita's star is shining brighter than ever, but she is once again chaffing under the weight of Ambrosio's authority... \n Future fate in Canon \n Lucita will participate in almost all major events of Cainite history, but her faith and drive will waver.

Unfortunately, it appears that he was not the actual artist, and had very few talents himself.

It then took a lowly fourteen years for Zamra to be acclaimed as Prince of Algiers and start extending her influence on all the Maghreb. Nahir certainly won his bet, but he might have created a political monster. \n Future fate in Canon \n Zamra will take no sides during the Anarch revolt, simply crushing anyone that thought her weak.
