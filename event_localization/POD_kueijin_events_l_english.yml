 podkueijin.1.t:0 "A Worthy Successor?"
 podkueijin.1.desc:0 "Your servants have returned with what promising Hungry Dead they could find. Some of them are more talented than others, but will also require more leverage to bind to your service. It will still be a gamble anyway, you don't have time to review them personally before making your choice, since the sudden attention you gave them will attract the notice of rivals."
 podkueijin.1.a:0 "I don't need someone too skilled. Lest they become a threat..."
 podkueijin.1.a.tt:0 "A new heir will appear, considered as your own childe."
 podkueijin.1.b:0 "This one seems tolerable at least."

 podkueijin.100.t:0 "Imbalance"
 podkueijin.100.desc:0 "Kuei-jin must regulate their Chi intake carefully, lest they suffer from Chi imbalance.

 podkueijin.101.t:0 "Ch'ing Shih"
 podkueijin.101.desc:0 "Ch'ing Shih are outright monstrosities and cannot pass as ordinary humans in any way. The Cathayan's flesh turns a sickly gray, while bones turn jet black. Skin wrinkles and compresses around bones. Fangs grow long and drip venom, and black spikes jut from back, joints, and rib cage. Entire body glows phosphorescently and sparks with Yin energy."
 podkueijin.101.a:0 "I am a monster between monsters."
 
 podkueijin.200.t:0 "Aspected Preference"
 podkueijin.200.desc:0 "Yin-aspected Cathayans are reservoirs for negative, death oriented energy. They tend to be calm, rational and cruel.\nYang-aspected Cathayans, by contrast, greedily consume life energy. They are passionate creatures, attuned to mortals and the emotions.\nSome Cathayans are creatures of Balance, their bodies maintaining life and death energies in equilibrium.\nWhich aspect do you wish to follow? It will change the way you spend chi."
 podkueijin.200.a:0 "Yin." 
 podkueijin.200.b:0 "Balanced." 
 podkueijin.200.c:0 "Yang."

 podkueijin.300.desc:0 "You call your servants to search information about chih-mei around your domain, and you have prepared the necessary material for the ritual that makes them become hin. You can specify more requirements to get more involved in the process, but the more specific you are, the more costly it will be.\nFirst, do you want some mortal that died recently and took the second breath, or some shih than lost all humanity and awakened their P'o?"
