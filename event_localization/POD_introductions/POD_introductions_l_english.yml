 podintroductions.1.desc:0 "As mortal France is reeling under the internal chaos of the albigensian crusade, vampiric France fares no better. Alexander, a 4th generation Ventrue, was prince of Paris and France until less than two years ago. He was ousted by a palace coup led by the Toreador Salianna, and his own childe, Geoffrey du Temple. The Toreador Queen has assumed control of the country and tries to consolidate her position, facing the opposition of her own clansmates, the other queens of France. On the other hand, Geoffrey has taken Paris itself as its prize but could, given time, made a bid for the crown that is his by right of blood. To the south, Esclarmonde of Toulouse is using the cathar uprising for her own purpose but could face the fury of northern France soon enough. Will the country finds a new, better, ruler than Alexander from this ordeal? Or will it be swept away in chaos and destruction?"

 podintroductions.2.desc:0 "Vampiric history of Britannia is closely linked to the Ventrue Mithras. Persian, than Roman, god, this 4th generation almost had the whole of Europe following his cult before Christianity drove him out. Retreating with his zealots in the land of the Brits, he quickly gathered power… and grew bored of the pettiness of the place. Failing regularly into torpor, the Norman invasion destroyed his seat of power and forced him to awoken to restore order. 150 years later, Mithras couldn’t care less about England again, and many of his subjects, like Hugh of Cornwall or Robin Leeland, have obtained de facto independence and plot his demise. Worse, Wales and Scotland are still upholding ancient cells of Druidic and Nordic Kindred. None can really say if Mithras will once again crush this new opposition or just let it fester under his nose until it’s too late."

Still, even his rule isn’t unchallenged, by pretenders like Julia Antasia of Western Germany or the elusive Ilse Reinegger of Bavaria. To the south, the usurpers of clan Tremere have a precarious position, with the vicious Tzimisce of Eastern Europe closing fast on their strongholds. Their defensive accord with the mighty Ventrue is perhaps their only lifeline. Close by lies Alexander of Paris, the exiled prince of France, a powerful Vampire by his own right, but alone politically. Hardestadt must act quickly, quelling the ambitions of his childe Jurgen, destroying Julia and Ilse powerbases and securing his eastern front with or without Tremere’s help. Germany will be the crown jewel of clan Ventrue, or burn trying."

To the north, Sylvester de Ruiz leads the official, Christian, clan Lasombra and has the clear ambition of ruling all of Iberia. He must take notice of his ambitious vassals though, the like of Ambrosio Luis Moncada or Lucita of Aragon. To the south, after decades of infighting, the Muslim Lasombra –who call themselves Ashirra- have found in Badr of Andalusia a worthy and proven sultan. Elsewhere, new and old princes, from regal Ventrue to feral Gangrel, take notice of the weakness of the Magisters and wait for the right moment to strike. This Reconquista could be the last breath of the Lasombra dominance of Iberia."

Some continue the fight though, like Brunhilde and Valbjorg ‘Crooked-Eye’, trying to destroy the invading Christian Vampires, led by Hardestadt’ get. One glimmer of optimism for the Einherjar is that the newcomers are hardly an united bunch, squabbling among themselves, most notably in Denmark which is divided between three pretenders. In the northern wastes, a band of callous furores calling themselves the Bar Sinister have staked a dubious claim on the barren land. Be they new allies or foes, the last battle of the Norse is drawing near, and the Cross seems like the clear favorite once again..."

In Venezia, the Giovanni scions of Clan Cappadocian are masters of a sea spanning trade empire, time will tell if their focus is on Italy proper or in the East, like their parent clan. In Sicily, the capital of clan Lasombra is guarded by the faithful Montano, but overextension and the civil war in Spain have left the Sea of Shadows vulnerable. Finally, all eyes are on Rome, where Titus Venturus Camille has recently awoken. The Eternal Consul was the mastermind behind Rome’s empire and Carthage’s destruction and could usher a new age for Ventrue leadership.

Most members of the weakened clan have gone into hiding, but Qawiyya intends to make a stand. Her precarious alliance is already in danger though, as mighty Damascus is falling into a literal pit of madness. Darshuf, the old Toreador sultan has sold his soul to untold forces, with only his childe and a lone Assamite warrior standing on the way of a catastrophe.

Even worse, Mesopotamia has fallen to the infernalists Baali once more, lead by Azanael of the Nergalite branch. His goal is to take the great cities of the region, Damascus, Baghdad and Tyr, to have the population he requires to sacrifice for his unholy master’s return. Ironically, his strongest opponent is Tanit of Tyr, another Baali, this one of the Molochim branch. This rivalry has plunged the resurgent Baali into civil war and gives hope to the Muslim faithful that they can be stopped. If not… then, the entire world could be at stake."

Thetmes of the Web of Knives wants the clan to become a fanatic cult of assassins prepared to serve as an army for the return of his black master. Al Ashrad of the Sorcerers is walking a path of moderation, viewing the Assamites as judges and diplomats. Finally, Jamal of the Warriors is a devout Muslim, and would welcome a rapprochement with the Ashirra Caliphate of Medina. This political unrest has helped the growth of another group in the region, the Lost Tribe of Dastur Anosh, an heretic venerating the Second Generation of vampires.

The two best poised to do so are Sophoniba, the very old leader of Tunis who still remembers the loss of her city alongside Carthage, and Zamra Matoub of Algiers, a young and ambitious Lasombra.
