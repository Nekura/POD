 PODbirthsabbat.0002.desc:0 "The hypocrisy and shameless arrogance of the Convention of Thorns are behind you now, and the newly created 'Camarilla' think they have won and secured the end of the Anarch Revolt.\nYou know better. The only thing the movement needs to win is a strong centralized leadership. Your leadership. You have been thinking about it since Thorns, what if you could create a sect to oppose the Camarilla?\nAlready, most of the Anarchs have joined this new, tantalizing, cause. The Sabbat is rising, will you be its herald?"

 PODbirthsabbat.0004.t:0 "Birth of the Sabbat"
 PODbirthsabbat.0004.desc:0 "The Anarch Revolt has been dealt a powerful blow by the Convention of Thorns and the birth of the Camarilla. The movement isn't dead though, and has actually been reborn into something more... sinister.\nThis new sect, calling themselves the Sabbat, has gathered a great deal of momentum among the disgruntled Anarchs. Its core tenets are still quite nebulous, but a clear opposition to the Camarilla is apparent, as the Masquerade is more lax, and the worship of Caine himself is allowed. It remains to be seen if these reformed Anarchs will just be a nuisance to the new Cainite order, or if they will be able to transform the nightly landscape once again."
 PODbirthsabbat.0004.a:0 "Maybe they are right?"
 PODbirthsabbat.0004.b:0 "They don't stand a chance" 
 PODbirthsabbat.100.t:0 "Paths of Enlightenment"
 PODbirthsabbat.100.desc:0 "Taking the lessons of the Roads from the Dark Ages, the Sabbat experiment with new Paths of Enlightenment. Path seeks to reconcile a vampire's beliefs and morals with their undead condition, to give their unlives a way of thinking that is compatible with the needs of the vampiric body and the demands of the Beast. Paths are active modes of morality, compared to Humanity's passivity. While a vampire with Humanity has his moral compass slowly eroded away and loses ground to the Beast, a Path follower fights it or accepts it as part of themselves. How will I decide?"
